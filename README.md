something to get me started

I'm typing this while at work,
I see a flock of birds just outside our glass doors,
they are feeding on scattered bird seeds,
each peck is satisfaction.

a kid comes to them running,
weilding a stick of some sort,
the birds froze
like the prey animal they are.

the kid starts flailing his stick,
to every direction it goes,
hitting nothing but air,
the birds fly away.

the bird is me,
the kid is me,
nothing makes sense.
